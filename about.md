I was born in Baltimore, Maryland, but moved away at a young age. I
lost my thick Carolina accent before I grew into childhood. I would fall asleep
to the whir of computers and the soft glow of monitors, and sometimes even to
the sound of my mother chipping away at a keyboard; a lullaby of plastic sounds and
a nightlight of pixels.

I attended [Wake Forest University](http://www.wfu.edu) and received degrees in
Computer Science and Theatre and Dance. I spent nine months in Kentucky as
an acting apprentice at the [Actors Theatre of
Louisville](http://www.actorstheatre.org).

Now I'm in New York City, hacking away at life.
