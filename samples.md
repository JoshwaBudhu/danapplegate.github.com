## MiO ##

A small Facebook application allowing users to share their favorite ways to
enjoy MiO. This is the base object class I wrote as part of a simple persistence
layer. Other classes extended this one, adding custom logic and more complex
relational queries, such as how many users have "liked" this particular post.
